# Horiseon Landing Page Code Refactoring

## Description
Here, I went over the code in both the index.html and the style.css files for the landing page. I merged 
gratuitious classes (multiple classes were made that did the same thing to several elements; e.g. the new 
"images" and "benefits" classes.) into single classes that did not repeat the same line more than once
and renamed the "hero" class to "centralpic" to make it more clear at a glance as to what it did (to best 
avoid confusion when everything else ).
